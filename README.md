## Requirements

 - Optimized for ARM64 Architecture.
</br>

## Getting Started
It only takes a few simple steps to install and setup **CNChart** to your project.
</br>

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager
Add `https://github.com/Chanooo/CNChart` as a dependency to your Package.swift file or select `File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency...` in Xcode.

### CocoaPods
The easiest way to install **CNChart** is to use <a href="http://cocoapods.org/" target="_blank">CocoaPods</a>. To do so, simply add the following line to your `Podfile`:
```ruby
pod 'CNChart'
```


 **Programmatical Initialization**  
 Just add the following code to your implementation (usually in the `viewDidLoad` method of your View Controller).

 ``` swift
let chart = CNChart(axis: .horizontal) // or .vertical
self.view.addSubview(chart)
 ```
 
 **Interface Builder Initialization**  
 1 - Drag a `UIStackView (Horizontal or Vertical)` to your `UIViewController`.  
 2 - Change the class of the new `UIStackView` to `CNChart`.  
 3 - (Option) If interface builder occurs an error, you could put fixed sized UIView inside of UIStackView.  
 4 - Select the `CNChart` and open the Attributes Inspector. Most of the customizable properties can easily be set from the Attributes Inspector. The Sample App demonstrates this capability.
